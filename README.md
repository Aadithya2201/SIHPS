## Problem Title

Real-Time Vehicle Tracking system.

## Problem Description

To develop a smart transportation system, which that aims to provide real-time information to the users regarding the availability of buses and their upcoming timings. The system will utilize advanced technologies such as GPS and other relevant services to gather the necessary data for providing reliable information to the users. The proposed system will have to be designed to facilitate the users in identifying the current location of their desired bus, along with the estimated time of its arrival at the respective bus stop. This will be achieved through the integration of the real-time data from the buses, as well as from the traffic management system. In conclusion, the proposed smart transportation system will significantly enhance the efficiency and convenience of the public transportation system in Himachal Pradesh. As a sustainability information to the user, good to indicate emission compliance of the bus e.g. Bharat Stage IV; also if the bus uses clean fuel such as CNG or Electricity

## Problem Creater's Organization
Govt of Himachal Pradesh


## Idea
One idea to implement this smart transportation system in Himachal Pradesh is to develop a mobile application that integrates real-time data from buses and the traffic management system
